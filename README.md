Scripts used for blue team security competitions. When adding scripts,
please add them to the readme file so that the team knows what they are
used for.

##Attack/Scan.py
Scan.py is a Python script that will scan a given IP range. It utilizes
threads to increase speeds and can be reconfigured for a fast, default
credentials SSH scan and auto login.

##Defense/Secure.sh
This is the main secure script for Linux based systems. At the end of the
script, someone needs to add an option menu to run the script for your
specific system service.
